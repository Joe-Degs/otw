I used nc to log into localhost on port 30000. After i found the flag for bandit14
on the server i used the ssh private key to log into.

the key was found in the directory 
/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

and i used this command to get the password for bandit15.
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000

the flag for bandit14
