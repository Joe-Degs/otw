The server was probed for open ports that communicated over ssl,
using `nmap localhost -p 31000-32000`

the ports were then tested one after the other for the compatible
ones.

openssl s_client -connect localhost:port -ign_eof

the output was a pem rsa private key for loging into the next
level using ssh
