This lesson was a little bit tough for me because this is my first time 
dealing with ports and connections on this level.
the challenge had an setuid ELF executable executable file thats connects
to any port given to it as an argument, then reads
input from the server which is supposed to be the password of the current 
level, matches it up with what is has and gives the password for the next
level if the match resolves to true.

I used the following commands.
for the server that was listening on the port 2010
 `nc -lv -p 2010` with the arguments
 `fidfhji3948dfe9r7d8f7sdf87df7df8dfd7f8d`

then the client was
`./suconnect 2010`
