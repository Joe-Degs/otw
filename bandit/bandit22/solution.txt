this way i solved this was a little bit easy because i expected
it to be tough lol, so when i got the key it i didnt take and
went on looking for it else where lol :).

This solution involved reading from the crontabs and and accessing
the cron.d directory.
i read the cronfile for the user which led to me finding a 
script that contained the password.
